# Magic the Ruling

## About

This project aims to build and deploy a locally hosted LLM (Large Language Model) specialized in answering Magic: The Gathering (MTG) rules-related questions using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).

## Objective

Magic: The Gathering is a constantly evolving game with new rules and mechanics emerging regularly. Judges are not always available to clarify complex interactions, and players often resort to searching online, hoping that their question has been previously asked or that the interaction is well-documented.

This approach is neither convenient nor efficient. A dedicated AI agent should be able to handle this tedious process more effectively. However, a standard LLM is not sufficient, as MTG's knowledge base is dynamicâ€”new card sets and mechanics are released multiple times a year, and even the game's core rules undergo periodic changes.

To address this, we are developing a Judge Agent capable of retrieving up-to-date rulings, interpreting complex game interactions, and adapting to new rulesets efficiently.
